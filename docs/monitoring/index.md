## Why This Matters

Monitoring and observability are essential for DevOps because:

- **Reliability**: Detect and resolve issues before they impact users
- **Performance**: Optimize system performance and resource utilization
- **Security**: Monitor for security threats and compliance violations
- **Business Intelligence**: Understand user behavior and system usage
- **Continuous Improvement**: Data-driven decisions for system optimization

With observability in place you can advance to resilience, governance, and platform concerns.
