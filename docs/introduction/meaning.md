# What DevOps Means (Working Definition)

DevOps aligns people, practices, and platforms to reduce lead time from idea to reliable customer value.

## Core Dimensions

| Dimension | Focus | Outcome |
|----------|-------|---------|
| Flow | Reducing friction in code-to-prod path | Faster delivery |
| Feedback | Rapid, actionable signals | Better quality decisions |
| Learning | Continuous improvement loops | Resilience & innovation |
| Shared Ownership | Blended dev / ops / sec accountability | Fewer handoffs |
| Automation | Repeatable, low-risk change execution | Consistency & speed |

## DevOps Is Not

- A single job title (though roles may champion practices)
- A fixed tool stack
- Only CI/CD pipelines
- Just "developers doing ops"

## Mental Model
Think of a value stream: Idea → Plan → Code → Build → Test → Release → Run → Observe → Improve. DevOps shortens and strengthens each transition.

## Anti-Patterns

| Pattern | Why Harmful |
|---------|-------------|
| "DevOps Team" as a silo | Recreates the wall of confusion |
| Tool-first adoption | Lacks cultural grounding; low ROI |
| Ignoring Ops toil | Leads to burnout and instability |
| Security bolted on late | Rework + risk accumulation |

## Maturity Signals (Early to Advanced)

- Manual scripts → Pipelines as code
- Pets → Immutable / declarative infra
- Log scraping → Structured observability (metrics, traces, logs)
- Heroic recovery → Engineered resilience + chaos experiments
- Change review bureaucracy → Automated policy + fast safe deploys
