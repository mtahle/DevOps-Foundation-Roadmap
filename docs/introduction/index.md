# DevOps Foundations Overview

This foundational section establishes the mindset, principles, and cultural underpinnings of modern DevOps before you dive into tooling and platform specifics.

## Objectives

- Understand what DevOps actually is (and is not)
- Place DevOps in historical context (from traditional Ops to agile + cloud-native)
- Learn the CALMS framework as a heuristic for maturity
- Recognize core practices that enable flow and reliability
- Build a shared vocabulary used throughout the rest of the roadmap

## Reading Path

1. History & Evolution
2. What DevOps Means (and Common Misconceptions)
3. CALMS Framework
4. Core Practices & Principles
5. Culture & Collaboration
6. Metrics, Feedback, and Continuous Improvement (future section)

> As you progress, refer back here to re-anchor decisions in foundational principles rather than tools.

## Quick Definition (Working Model)
DevOps is a socio-technical approach that shortens feedback loops between code, infrastructure, and users by integrating development, operations, security, and quality practices into a continuous value delivery system.

## Out of Scope (For Now)

- Deep cloud vendor specifics
- Service mesh, multi-cluster scaling strategies
- Advanced FinOps or platform engineering patterns

Those appear later once the fundamentals of flow, feedback, and culture are internalized.
