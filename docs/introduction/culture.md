# Culture & Collaboration

Culture amplifies or negates every technical investment. Sustainable DevOps depends on psychological safety, shared ownership, and continuous learning.

## Core Cultural Tenets

| Tenet | Description | Signal |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| Psychological Safety | People can surface risk & mistakes | Honest retros |
| Shared Ownership | Teams own build â†’ run lifecycle | On-call rotates include devs |
| Transparency | Work & system state visible | Dashboards, WIP limits |
| Experimentation | Safe-to-try mindset | Small reversible changes |
| Continuous Learning | Institutional memory improves | Documented postmortems |

## Communication Patterns

- Prefer async documentation + succinct synchronous alignment
- Use runbooks & decision records (ADR) to reduce tribal knowledge
- Adopt incident channels with clear roles (commander, scribe, SMEs)

## Blameless Postmortems

| Element | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Timeline | Establish factual sequence |
| Impact | Quantify user/business effect |
| Contributing Factors | Systemic causes (avoid single blame) |
| Remediations | Actionable, owned follow-ups |
| Learning | Patterns to propagate |

## Operating Models

| Model | Trade-Off |
|-------|----------|
| Embedded SRE | Deep context, scaling headcount |
| Central Platform Team | Reuse & standards, risk of gatekeeping |
| Guild/Community of Practice | Cross-pollination, needs facilitation |

## Anti-Patterns

- Hero culture (reward firefighting over prevention)
- Hidden work & invisible toil
- Blame-focused incident reviews
- Overloaded gatekeeper teams

## Practical Starting Moves

- Introduce lightweight incident template
- Track toil hours vs. project work
- Run quarterly culture health retro
- Publish internal glossary of key terms
