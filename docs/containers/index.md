## 💡 Why This Matters

Containers are essential for modern DevOps because:

- **Portability**: Applications run consistently across environments
- **Scalability**: Easy horizontal scaling and resource optimization
- **Microservices**: Enable microservice architectures and service mesh
- **CI/CD**: Streamlined build, test, and deployment pipelines
- **Resource Efficiency**: Better resource utilization than traditional VMs
