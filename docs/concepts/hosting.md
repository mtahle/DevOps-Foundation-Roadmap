!!! tip "Learning Path"
    Start with shared hosting to understand the basics, then progress to VPS and eventually to cloud infrastructure as your skills grow.

## Next Steps

After understanding hosting fundamentals you are ready to move from conceptual/web hosting into operating real systems:

- Proceed to the Linux & Systems track: [Linux Introduction](../linux/introduction.md) – learn shell, processes, services
- Then explore: [Web Hosting (Linux Focus)](../linux/web-hosting.md) – apply hosting concepts on Linux servers
- Start thinking about automation foundations before scale: [Automation Introduction](../automation/introduction.md) (optional preview)

If you need to revisit security fundamentals later, the earlier pages on protocols, SSL/TLS, and DNS remain reference material.

!!! info "DevOps Relevance"
  Hosting knowledge is essential for infrastructure planning, capacity management, and understanding application deployment requirements.
