# Internet Basics

Understanding how the internet works is fundamental to DevOps engineering. This section covers the core concepts you need to know to build, deploy, and troubleshoot modern applications and infrastructure.

## How Does the Internet Work?

The internet is a global network of interconnected computers that communicate using standardized protocols. Understanding its architecture helps you troubleshoot issues, design better systems, and make informed decisions about performance, security, and scalability.

!!! info "Learning Objectives"
    After completing this section, you'll be able to:
    
    - Define what 'Internet' means and how computer networks function
    - Understand packet switching and networking protocols
    - Identify key networking hardware components
    - Explain how data travels from your device to servers worldwide
    - Troubleshoot basic network connectivity issues

## What is the Internet?

The Internet is essentially a **network of networks** - a vast, sprawling collection of interconnected computer networks that can communicate with each other. Think of it like a social network, but instead of people, it's computers sharing information globally.

### Core Concepts

#### 1. Distributed Network Architecture

```mermaid

    A[Your Device] --> B[Local Router]
    B --> C[ISP Network]
    C --> D[Internet Backbone]
    D --> E[Destination ISP]
    E --> F[Destination Router]
    F --> G[Target Server]
    
    style A fill:#e1f5fe
    style G fill:#e8f5e8
    style D fill:#fff3e0
```

The Internet has no central control point - it's **distributed** by design. This means:

- **Resilience**: If one path fails, data can take alternative routes
- **Scalability**: New networks can join without disrupting existing ones
- **Decentralization**: No single entity controls the entire Internet

#### 2. How Data Travels: Packets and Protocols

When you request a webpage or send an email, your data doesn't travel as one large chunk. Instead, it's broken into small pieces called **packets**.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User as Your Browser
    participant DNS as DNS Server
    participant Server as Web Server
    
    User->>DNS: 1. What's the IP for example.com?
    DNS-->>User: 2. IP: 192.0.2.1
    User->>Server: 3. TCP Handshake
    Server-->>User: 4. Connection Established
    User->>Server: 5. HTTP Request (GET /page)
    Server-->>User: 6. HTTP Response (HTML, CSS, JS)
    
    Note over User,Server: Data sent as multiple packets
```

##### Packet Structure

Each packet contains:
- **Header**: Destination address, source address, packet number
- **Payload**: The actual data being transmitted
- **Checksum**: Error detection mechanism

##### Why Packets?

- **Efficiency**: Multiple users can share the same network infrastructure
- **Reliability**: Lost packets can be retransmitted without resending everything
- **Flexibility**: Packets can take different routes to reach their destination

## Key Internet Protocols

Protocols are standardized rules that allow different devices and software to communicate effectively.

### Essential Protocol Stack

```mermaid

    A[Application Layer<br/>HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SMTP] --> B[Transport Layer<br/>TCP, UDP]
    B --> C[Internet Layer<br/>IP, ICMP]
    C --> D[Link Layer<br/>Ethernet, WiFi]
    
    style A fill:#ffcdd2
    style B fill:#f8bbd9
    style C fill:#e1bee7
    style D fill:#d1c4e9
```

#### 1. **HTTP/HTTPS** (Application Layer)
- **Purpose**: Web communication protocol
- **HTTP**: Plain text communication
- **HTTPS**: Encrypted HTTP using TLS/SSL
- **DevOps Relevance**: Web applications, APIs, microservices communication

#### 2. **TCP** (Transport Layer)
- **Purpose**: Reliable, ordered data delivery
- **Features**: Error checking, flow control, congestion control
- **Use Cases**: Web browsing, file transfers, database connections

#### 3. **UDP** (Transport Layer)
- **Purpose**: Fast, lightweight data delivery
- **Trade-off**: Speed over reliability
- **Use Cases**: Video streaming, online gaming, DNS queries

#### 4. **IP** (Internet Layer)
- **Purpose**: Addressing and routing packets
- **IPv4**: 32-bit addresses (e.g., 192.168.1.1)
- **IPv6**: 128-bit addresses (future-proofing)

## Physical Infrastructure

### Network Hardware Components

```mermaid

    subgraph "Your Home/Office"
        A[Device] --> B[Switch]
        B --> C[Router]
    end
    
    C --> D[ISP Network]
    D --> E[Internet Backbone]
    E --> F[Content Delivery Network]
    F --> G[Web Server]
    
    style A fill:#e3f2fd
    style G fill:#e8f5e8
    style E fill:#fff3e0
```

#### **Routers**
- **Function**: Forward packets between different networks
- **Analogy**: Traffic cops directing vehicles to correct destinations
- **DevOps Context**: Network segmentation, load balancing

#### **Switches**
- **Function**: Connect devices within the same network
- **Method**: Packet switching to correct devices
- **DevOps Context**: Data center networking, VLAN management

#### **Servers**
- **Function**: Store and serve content, applications, databases
- **Types**: Web servers, application servers, database servers
- **DevOps Context**: The infrastructure you'll be managing and deploying to

### Global Infrastructure

- **Fiber Optic Cables**: Backbone of internet connectivity
- **Data Centers**: House servers and networking equipment
- **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)**: Distribute content globally for faster access
- **Internet Exchange Points (IXPs)**: Where different networks interconnect

## Real-World Example: Loading a Website

Let's trace what happens when you visit a website:

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **DNS Query**: Browser asks "What's the IP address for example.com?"
2. **TCP Handshake**: Browser establishes connection with server
3. **TLS Handshake**: Secure encryption is set up (for HTTPS)
4. **HTTP Request**: Browser requests the webpage
5. **HTTP Response**: Server sends HTML, CSS, JavaScript as packets
6. **Rendering**: Browser assembles packets and displays the page

### Timing Breakdown
- DNS Query: ~20-100ms
- TCP Handshake: ~20-200ms
- TLS Handshake: ~100-500ms
- HTTP Request/Response: ~50-500ms

**Total**: Often under 1 second for a simple page!
