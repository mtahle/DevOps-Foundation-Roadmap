# DevOps Practices

DevOps practices aim to bridge the gap between development and operations teams. Key practices include:

- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Frequently merging code changes into a shared repository.
- **Continuous Delivery (CD)**: Automating the release process to deliver software quickly and reliably.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Managing infrastructure using code and automation tools.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Ensuring system health and performance through proactive monitoring.

This section will provide an in-depth look at these practices and their implementation.
